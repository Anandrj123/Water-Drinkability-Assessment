## Introduction

Clean and safe drinking water is crucial for human health. This project leverages machine learning models to assess the drinkability of water by analyzing different water quality features. The Decision Tree and KNN models are implemented to predict whether water is safe for consumption.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various water quality parameters. The dataset should be divided into features (independent variables) and the target variable, indicating water drinkability (safe or unsafe). Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for model training.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-drinkability-assessment.git
   

## Models
### Decision Tree
The Decision Tree model is a tree-like model that makes decisions based on the features of the input data. It is interpretable and can provide insights into the decision-making process.

### k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The KNN model classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. It is a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks.

### Evaluation
The models' performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation results will be displayed in the console after running the main script.
